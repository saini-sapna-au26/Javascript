// LECTURE: Iteration: The for Loop
// 1. There are elections in your country! In a small town, there are only 50 voters.
// Use a for loop to simulate the 50 people voting, by logging a string like this to
// the console (for numbers 1 to 50): 'Voter number 1 is currently voting'

for (let vote = 1; vote <= 50; vote++) {
  console.log(`Voter number ${vote} is currently voting`);
}
