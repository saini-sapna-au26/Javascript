// LECTURE: let, const and var
// 1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some
// countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
// 2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
// change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
// 3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens

let language;

language = "hindi";
// in let we can update
const country = "india";
const continent = "asia";
const island = false;
// island = true;    Error
// but in const we can not update the variable into values
